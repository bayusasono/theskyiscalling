      <h1>Hello! 👋</h1>
      <p>The narrative behind my first voyage into dataviz is to apply it to my personal <b>flight simulator hobby ✈️,</b> based on the flight logs of the flights I have taken in the simulation over 12 months (24APR2022-29APR2023). I am hoping to uncover interesting insights by looking at various data points, such as the day of flight (in relation to personal life), number of hours spent flying, the different types of aircraft used, the average time spent in the air, and the routes taken from my flights within <b>Microsoft Flight Simulator,</b> tracked using <b>Volanta.</b></p>
